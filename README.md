I chose to use React.js to create the spa trying to be as faithful to the design as possible. I would have loved to add the accordeon but I simply did not have enough time to do so. I did deploy a live version for you to see, I will leave the link below. If you clone the repository or download the zip file, you can start the code with "npm start" (if you clone the repository you will have to use "npm install" first)
